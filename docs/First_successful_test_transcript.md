## Observations and Issues to Address

1. **Tone**: The conversation was noted as being too robotic. The assistant should be more cheerful and personable.

2. **Introduction**: The assistant should identify itself as "Samantha, an automated agent working at DentaVille" at the beginning of the call.

3. **Generic References**: The assistant used "[Doctor's Office]" instead of "DentaVille" and didn't introduce itself with a name.

4. **Appointment Details**: The assistant mentioned "March 5th at 10:30 AM with Dr. Smith" without having received this information from the user or database.

5. **Interruptions**: The AI was interrupted several times, possibly due to turn detection sensitivity.

## Next Steps

1. Update the system prompt to make the assistant more cheerful and personable
2. Modify the introduction to include the specific identity ("Samantha from DentaVille")
3. Replace generic placeholders with specific business information
4. Ensure the assistant properly uses the appointment data
5. Conduct further research on DentaVille's brand voice and values to better align the prompts
6. Remove debug logging and only print transcript-related information
